How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to interpret the user needs is to ask questions to the users. This can be direct feedback with reviews or indirect with social boards. This is a great way to see what the pros and cons are with the software. Also, it can give an insight to what the users are wanting with any additional features or features that are nonfunctioning. Another great way to get ahead of the user demands is to create a test market for a select feature and see how the users react. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

With any projects and developing programs the best practice is to lay the framework in lucid charts. This is very useful to show how the different codes interact with each other and what each segment needs to accomplish. I am a visual person and having the references is key to my success. There are a few aspects I am taking away from the Agile process. Testing the code several times is one I need to do more often. I get in a pattern of typing out several lines at a time before testing them. Using lucid charts has been a great tool to stay organized. The last part would be the scrum meeting process. Being vulnerable to say what you do not understand and having a supportive team is a safe space to have personal growth with developing skills.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good member of a team is to always show improvement. We all start at the same point, but it is how to push ourselves to improve. A great team member is honest with their skillset and always seeking a way to improve. There are several different ways to write code and we will develop our own signature style. It is great to be flexible in our writing where we can adapt it with collaborative writing. Last, the willingness to help others. It is the task to stop what we are doing and to help someone else. We must keep in mind it is not about our personal success but the success of the team. If we can share our knowledge and teach something new, it can help lead for a greater success tomorrow.
